College life is already a confusing period of any student's life. Vision'Ed aims to minimise the confusion by integrating all necessary resources that makes up college
life into one smooth, slick and easy-to-use web application. Instead of having to rely on various different resources for notes, assignment submission, event informations, announcements and networking, Vision'Ed integrates all functionalities into one. Thus it builds clarity, unity and
allows timely relaying of crucial resources and information to all.
